Suppose we want to know an individual's probability of having cancer, but we know nothing about them. Despite not knowing anything about that person, a probability can be assigned based on the general prevalence of cancer. For the sake of this example, suppose it is 1%. This is known as the base rate or prior probability of having cancer. "Prior" refers to the time before being informed about the particular case at hand.:p
