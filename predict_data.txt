Problems using Bayes' Theorem are often more easily grasped by applying the conditions given in the problem to a large pool of observations. Assume, for example, that a community consists of 100,000 people. According to the statement of the problem, 1% of the population, or 1,000 people will have cancer. 0.2% of the population, or 200 people, will be 65 years old. Of the 1000 people with cancer, only .5%, or 5 people, will be 65 years old. Thus, of the 200 people who are 65, only 5 can be expected to have cancer. 5/200 = 2.5%.
